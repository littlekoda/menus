## ✴️ 1. Bias: **Bearish**

- Price broke down from the **6634–6636 consolidation area** and is now testing the **VWAP (6627)**.
- EMA(9), EMA(21), and EMA(50) are flattening to sloping down → short-term trend turning negative.
- **RSI 38.6** and **Stoch 13.9** show momentum washout, but no reversal yet.
- Volume spike on breakdown (317 vs avg 160) confirms **supply pressure**.

## 🟦 2. Trade Thesis

> The market failed to sustain highs near **6639** and rotated lower.  
> A breakdown through **6634 support** with strong volume suggests sellers are in control.  
> With momentum indicators weak and price sitting on VWAP support,  
> a further test of **6625–6622** is likely before buyers defend.

## 🎯 3. Potential Entry Trigger

- 🔻 **Short trigger**: A clean break below **6626.50** with volume > avg (160).
- 🔺 **Alternate entry**: If price retests **6632–6634** (prior support / EMA cluster)  
  and rejects with a bearish candle, consider fading the bounce.
